Location: Asteroid Field near Novae Spes
Date: c+198.10.25

An Hegemony fleet is standing in the asteroid field closest to Novae Spes.

Long range scans indicate the fleet is gathering resources and possibly installing sensor arrays to scout enemy activity in the region.

This action is highly suspect and disrespectful, giving the Syndicate as many valid reasons to engage in combat as in any other situation.

CAUTION!!!
The whole region is a dense asteroid field, proceed with caution!
A fleet composed by smaller, agile ships, has been dispatched to engage the enemy fleet, as sending any large capital ships would make this missions more hazardous than it already is.

WARNING!!!
May cause light/severe FPS drops due to the amount of asteroids present, depending on your hardware!
