	### MODULES (FEATURES) ###
	# The following features may be enabled/disabled at any time if they do not fit your play style.
	# Changing these options may require a new save for its effects to be noticeable!
	# Enjoy!

	# NOTE: The options that are "Forced to false!!!" will not work even if you set them to true,
	# they have been disabled in the code itself due to being incomplete, untested or both.
	
	## Set of FDS related quests and story. Disabled by default. NOT RELEASED
	"fdsStoryline":false,#Forced to false!!  # Default: false

	## "Droid Mechanics" is an attempt to recreate the "Extra Crew" mechanics
	# from the mod "Starsector+" but with "Maintenance Bots" instead of crew.
	# Version 3.7.0 of SS+ does not contain the Extra Crew mechanics!
	# The buff formula is pretty much as follows:
	# (maintenanceBotsInCargo / 2) / fleetTotalSuppliesPerMonth
	# Short answer: Having twice as many "Maintenance Bots" as the total fleet supply cost per month provides the maximum buff possible.
	# Disabled by default.
	"droidMechanics":false, # Default: false
